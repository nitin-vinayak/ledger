        <h3>About Ledger</h3>
        <p>
          Ledger was developed because I felt that tools like Notion lacked the
          necessary nuance for trading journals. <br />
          Ledger includes features like graphs, statistics and algorithms such
          as cluster analysis to identify advantages<br />
          in trading systems.
